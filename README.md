## About
This is my personal development site that I decided to create in Svelte because I had never used it before! It was super fun learning Svelte. I definitely plan on using it in the future for getting Single Page Apps up and going because of how easy and fast it is to set up. Build times are so fast in Svelte, making the development process feel so smooth and buttery.
