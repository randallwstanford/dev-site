      I recently completed Hack Reactor's software engineering bootcamp in Novemeber of 2021 and I had an incredible, rich, and fruitful expereince. In Hack Reactor we cover a whole lot from frontend, backend, deployment, data persistence, developer tools, reading documentation, being self autonomous as developer, and more. I love learning about all things tech, especially frontend development, database management, and the shell environment.

      I have always had a strong passion and love for coffee that lead to learning about coffee roasting, coffee processing, and the coffee supply chain. After 7 years of deep diving into the coffee industry, of I decided it was not a sustainable or fufilling career for myself. I had a knack and curiosity about technology, so I looked to software development as a new career path. After a year of self studying javascript, I saved up, quit my job, and took a leap to take the bootcamp and kickstart my career.
